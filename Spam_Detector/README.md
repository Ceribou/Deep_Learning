## Company's Description ðŸ“‡

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered at Whitacre Tower in Downtown Dallas, Texas.

## Project ðŸš§

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.
